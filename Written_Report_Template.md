# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

  An analysis of several crowdfunding campaigns and how each fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This is to help up and coming Kickstarters gain a       greater understanding of funding campaigns from start to finish.

### Purpose
  
  To determine whether there are specific factors that make a funding campaign successful and enable new Kickstarters to set their campaigns to mirror other successful               crowdfunding campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges
    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  There were no challenges encountered; however, there could have been challenges if the differing functions (Vlookup or Count If) or formulas were not performed correctly. If any   one piece of these are off, it can change the whole outcome which would alter the final analysis. 

## Results

  Based on the analysis pertaining to the Outcomes based on Launch Date, the following can be concluded;
  
     - The most successful time of the year to launch a Theater crowdfunding campaign is May and June
     - The least successful time of the year to launch a Theater crowdfunding campaign is December

  Based on the analysis pertaining to the Outcomes based on Goals, the following can be concluded;
      The highest percentage of successful campaigns with a 76% success rate had a goal of less than $1000 and closely following with 73% is the goal range of $1000 to $4999.           Campaigns with a goal of less than $5000 have the most successful outcomes.  

  The analysis performed is based on what data is available and a misrepresentation of the outcome could result due to missing, duplicate and/or errors in the existing dataset. 

  Additionally, a comparison to look at the relation of a successful campaign vs the Country where it was launched could also have been created. There could be a conclusion         formulated that the location of where a campaign is launched could determine the success. A particular country culturally could have a higher love for the Arts.
